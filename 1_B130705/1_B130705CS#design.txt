 #Client Program
  Takes integer N from the User.(Waits till it gets a valid integer).
  Sends integer N to server program.
  Takes N integers one by one from the User.
  Sends N integers to server program one by one.
  Receives the sorted integers from the server program and displays it.

  input : N , set of N integers
  output: sorted integers returned by the server program.

  Functions used: 
	1. getInt() : force a user to input positive a integer.
	2. create() : fills the values of the struct sockaddr_in.


 #Server Program
  Receives N from the user program.
  Receives set of N integers from user program.
  Sorts the integer using bubble sort.
  Sends the sorted integers back to user program.

  input : N , set of N integers
  output: sorted integers returned by the server program.

  Functions used: 
	1. create() : fills the values of the struct sockaddr_in.
